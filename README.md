flasher
=======

Rails flash that works for ajax and old-fashion page loads. Tested on Rails 4.1 (with Turbolinks).

## Installation

Add ```gem 'flasher', github: "martianinteractive/flasher"``` to your Gemfile
Add ```//= require flasher``` to your app/assets/javascripts/application.js
Add ```*= require flasher``` to your app/assets/stylesheets/application.css

That's it.
